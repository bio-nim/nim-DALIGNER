##   Local alignment module.  Routines for finding local alignments given a seed position,
##     representing such an l.a. with its interval and a set of pass-thru points, so that
##     a detailed alignment can be efficiently computed on demand.
##
##   All routines work on a numeric representation of DNA sequences, i.e. 0 for A, 1 for C,
##     2 for G, and 3 for T.

## ** INTERACTIVE vs BATCH version
##
##      The defined constant INTERACTIVE (set in DB.h) determines whether an interactive or
##        batch version of the routines in this library are compiled.  In batch mode, routines
##        print an error message and exit.  In interactive mode, the routines place the error
##        message in EPLACE (also defined in DB.h) and return an error value, typically NULL
##        if the routine returns a pointer, and an unusual integer value if the routine returns
##        an integer.
##      Below when an error return is described, one should understand that this value is returned
##        only if the routine was compiled in INTERACTIVE mode.
##
## *
## ** PATH ABSTRACTION:
##
##      Coordinates are *between* characters where 0 is the tick just before the first char,
##      1 is the tick between the first and second character, and so on.  Our data structure
##      is called a Path refering to its conceptualization in an edit graph.
##
##      A local alignment is specified by the point '(abpos,bbpos)' at which its path in
##      the underlying edit graph starts, and the point '(aepos,bepos)' at which it ends.
##      In otherwords A[abpos+1..aepos] is aligned to B[bbpos+1..bepos] (assuming X[1] is
##      the *first* character of X).
##
##      There are 'diffs' differences in an optimal local alignment between the beginning and
##      end points of the alignment (if computed by Compute_Trace), or nearly so (if computed
##      by Local_Alignment).
##
##      Optionally, a Path can have additional information about the exact nature of the
##      aligned substrings if the field 'trace' is not NULL.  Trace points to either an
##      array of integers (if computed by a Compute_Trace routine), or an array of unsigned
##      short integers (if computed by Local_Alignment).
##
##      If computed by Local_Alignment 'trace' points at a list of 'tlen' (always even) short
##      values:
##
##             d_0, b_0, d_1, b_1, ... d_n-1, b_n-1, d_n, b_n
##
##      to be interpreted as follows.  The alignment from (abpos,bbpos) to (aepos,bepos)
##      passes through the n trace points for i in [1,n]:
##
##             (a_i,b_i) where a_i = floor(abpos/TS)*TS + i*TS
##                         and b_i = bbpos + (b_0 + b_1 + b_i-1)
##
##      where also let a_0,b_0 = abpos,bbpos and a_(n+1),b_(n+1) = aepos,bepos.  That is, the
##      interior (i.e. i != 0 and i != n+1) trace points pass through every TS'th position of
##      the aread where TS is the "trace spacing" employed when finding the alignment (see
##      New_Align_Spec).  Typically TS is 100.  Then d_i is the number of differences in the
##      portion of the alignment between (a_i,b_i) and (a_i+1,b_i+1).  These trace points allow
##      the Compute_Trace routines to efficiently compute the exact alignment between the two
##      reads by efficiently computing exact alignments between consecutive pairs of trace points.
##      Moreover, the diff values give one an idea of the quality of the alignment along every
##      segment of TS symbols of the aread.
##
##      If computed by a Compute_Trace routine, 'trace' points at a list of 'tlen' integers
##      < i1, i2, ... in > that encodes an exact alignment as follows.  A negative number j
##      indicates that a dash should be placed before A[-j] and a positive number k indicates
##      that a dash should be placed before B[k], where A and B are the two sequences of the
##      overlap.  The indels occur in the trace in the order in which they occur along the
##      alignment.  For a good example of how to "decode" a trace into an alignment, see the
##      code for the routine Print_Alignment.

## ** ALIGNMENT ABSTRACTION:
##
##      An alignment is modeled by an Alignment record, which in addition to a *pointer* to a
##      'path', gives pointers to the A and B sequences, their lengths, and indicates whether
##      the B-sequence needs to be complemented ('comp' non-zero if so).  The 'trace' pointer
##      of the 'path' subrecord can be either NULL, a list of pass-through points, or an exact
##      trace depending on what routines have been called on the record.
##
##      One can (1) compute a trace, with Compute_Trace, either from scratch if 'path.trace' = NULL,
##      or using the sequence of pass-through points in trace, (2) print an ASCII representation
##      of an alignment, or (3) reverse the roles of A and B, and (4) complement a sequence
##      (which is a reversible process).
##
##      If the alignment record shows the B sequence as complemented, *** THEN IT IS THE
##      RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CALLER *** to make sure that bseq points at a complement of
##      the sequence before calling Compute_Trace or Print_Alignment.  Complement_Seq complements
##      the sequence a of length n.  The operation does the complementation/reversal in place.
##      Calling it a second time on a given fragment restores it to its original state.
##
##      With the introduction of the DAMAPPER, we need to code chains of alignments between a
##      pair of sequences.  The alignments of a chain are expected to be found in order either on
##      a file or in memory, where the START_FLAG marks the first alignment and the NEXT_FLAG all
##      subsequent alignmenst in a chain.  A chain of a single LA is marked with the START_FLAG.
##      The BEST_FLAG marks one of the best chains for a pair of sequences.  The convention is
##      that either every record has either a START- or NEXT-flag, or none of them do (e.g. as
##      produced by daligner), so one can always check the flags of the first alignment to see
##      whether or not the chain concept applies to a given collection or not.

##  Local_Alignment seeks local alignments of a quality determined by a number of parameters.
##      These are coded in an Align_Spec object that can be created with New_Align_Spec and
##      freed with Free_Align_Spec when no longer needed.  There are 4 essential parameters:
##
##      ave_corr:    the average correlation (1 - 2*error_rate) for the sought alignments.  For Pacbio
##                     data we set this to .70 assuming an average of 15% error in each read.
##      trace_space: the spacing interval for keeping trace points and segment differences (see
##                     description of 'trace' for Paths above)
##      freq[4]:     a 4-element vector where afreq[0] = frequency of A, f(A), freq[1] = f(C),
##                     freq[2] = f(G), and freq[3] = f(T).  This vector is part of the header
##                     of every HITS database (see db.h).
##
##      If an alignment cannot reach the boundary of the d.p. matrix with this condition (i.e.
##      overlap), then the last/first 30 columns of the alignment are guaranteed to be
##      suffix/prefix positive at correlation ave_corr * g(freq) where g is an empirically
##      measured function that increases from 1 as the entropy of freq decreases.  If memory is
##      unavailable or the freq distribution is too skewed then NULL is returned.
##
##      You can get back the original parameters used to create an Align_Spec with the simple
##      utility functions below.

##  Local_Alignment finds the longest significant local alignment between the sequences in
##      'align' subject to:
##
##        (a) the alignment criterion given by the Align_Spec 'spec',
##        (b) it passes through one of the points (anti+k)/2,(anti-k)/2 for k in [low,hgh] within
##              the underlying dynamic programming matrix (i.e. the points on diagonals low to hgh
##              on anti-diagonal anti or anti-1 (depending on whether the diagonal is odd or even)),
##        (c) if lbord >= 0, then the alignment is always above diagonal low-lbord, and
##        (d) if hbord >= 0, then the alignment is always below diagonal hgh+hbord.
##
##      The path record of 'align' has its 'trace' filled from the point of view of an overlap
##      between the aread and the bread.  In addition a Path record from the point of view of the
##      bread versus the aread is returned by the function, with this Path's 'trace' filled in
##      appropriately.  The space for the returned path and the two 'trace's are in the working
##      storage supplied by the Work_Data packet and this space is reused with each call, so if
##      one wants to retain the bread-path and the two trace point sequences, then they must be
##      copied to user-allocated storage before calling the routine again.  NULL is returned in
##      the event of an error.
##
##      Find_Extension is a variant of Local_Alignment that simply finds a local alignment that
##      either ends (if prefix is non-zero) or begins (if prefix is zero) at the point
##      (anti+diag)/2,(anti-diag)/2).  All other parameters are as before.  It returns a non-zero
##      value only when INTERACTIVE is on and it cannot allocate the memory it needs.
##      Only the path and trace with respect to the aread is returned.  This routine is experimental
##      and may not persist in later versions of the code.

##  Given a legitimate Alignment object, Compute_Trace_X computes an exact trace for the alignment.
##      If 'path.trace' is non-NULL, then it is assumed to be a sequence of pass-through points
##      and diff levels computed by Local_Alignment.  In either case 'path.trace' is set
##      to point at an integer array within the storage of the Work_Data packet encoding an
##      exact optimal trace from the start to end points.  If the trace is needed beyond the
##      next call to a routine that sets it, then it should be copied to an array allocated
##      and managed by the caller.
##
##      Compute_Trace_ALL does not require a sequence of pass-through points, as it computes the
##      best alignment between (path->abpos,path->bbpos) and (path->aepos,path->bepos) in the
##      edit graph between the sequences.  Compute_Trace_PTS computes a trace by computing the
##      trace between successive pass through points.  It is much, much faster than Compute_Trace_ALL
##      but at the tradeoff of not necessarily being optimal as pass-through points are not all
##      perfect.  Compute_Trace_MID computes a trace by computing the trace between the mid-points
##      of alignments between two adjacent pairs of pass through points.  It is generally twice as
##      slow as Compute_Trace_PTS, but it produces nearer optimal alignments.  All these routines
##      return 1 if an error occurred and 0 otherwise.

##
##      If the alignment trace is an exact trace, then one can ask Print_Alignment to print an

##      by "indent" spaces and put "width" columns per line in the display.  Show "border"
##      characters of sequence on each side of the aligned region.  If upper is non-zero then
##      display bases in upper case.  If coord is greater than 0, then the positions of the
##      first character in A and B in the given row is displayed with a field width given by

##
##      Print_Reference is like Print_Alignment but rather than printing exaclty "width" columns

## ** OVERLAP ABSTRACTION:
##
##      Externally, between modules an Alignment is modeled by an "Overlap" record, which

##      (b) does not contain the length of the 2 sequences (must fetch from DB), and
##      (c) contains its path as a subrecord rather than as a pointer (indeed, typically the
##      corresponding Alignment record points at the Overlap's path sub-record).  The trace pointer
##      is always to a sequence of trace points and can be either compressed (uint8) or
##      uncompressed (uint16).  One can read and write binary records of an "Overlap".

##  Read_Overlap reads the next Overlap record from stream 'input', not including the trace

##      accommodate the trace where each value take 'tbytes' bytes (1 if uint8 or 2 if uint16).
##
##      Write_Overlap write 'ovl' to stream 'output' followed by its trace vector (if any) that
